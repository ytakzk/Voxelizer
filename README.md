Voxelizer provides a set of functions to voxelize a mesh. Any closed mesh can be transformed into a collection of voxels. The size of voxels is adjastable. Plus, Voxelizer can automatically close meshes even if they are opened. It is of cource better than you feed a closed mesh though, just give it a try with any meshes you want. Let's get voxelized!
